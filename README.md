Edible and Poisonous Mushroom Detection Using Machine Learning


Nature alone is antique and the oldest art a mushroom.” ~ Thomas Carlyle

Mushrooms!! Creamy Mushroom Bruschetta, Mushroom Risotto, Mushroom pizza, Mushrooms in a burger, 
and what not! Just by hearing the names of these dishes, people be drooling! Their flavor is one 
reason that takes the dish to the next level!

But have you ever wondered if the mushroom you eat is healthy for you? From over 50,000 species of 
mushrooms only in North America, how will you classify the mushroom as edible or poisonous? Poisonous 
mushrooms can be hard to identify in the wild!




Introductions:
Mushrooms are one of the healthiest food on the planet that grow without any efforts. It can grow on/in the ground or on other planets. Mushroom used as an ingredient in most food industry, it has great benefits to our body, where it contains most potent nutrients on the plant such as calcium, phosphorus, vitamins and proteins. Mushroom is used to treat cancer, eradicating viruses, increase immunity system, lose weight, and for good diet programs. Recently, the use of mushroom has been increased by people. However, mushroom can be classified as edible or inedible (poisonous). There are many types of mushrooms and 50-100 types cannot be eaten or we can say that most of mushrooms cannot be eaten and eating collected mushroom directly without knowing it’s type is a big mistake and the effect of eating inedible mushroom range from simple symptoms to death. People is looking at the physical characteristic of the mushroom such as shape, neck length, head diameter, size, color and its environment to decide whether its edible or inedible. Huge amount of mushroom’s data collected over years and applications developed to classify mushrooms. Different classification techniques developed and improved to give more accurate decision. The classification algorithms compared for the highest accuracy.

Various Parts Of the Mushroom Plant Typically, a Mushroom has six different parts. These include:
-1>Cap: This is the part that gives the fungi its umbrella shape. The cap comes in a variety of colors, including white, brown, and yellow. In the same way that umbrellas protect us from the heat of the sun, rain, and other harsh weather conditions, the mushroom cap protects the pores or gills where mushroom spores are produced. And what are spores? Well, consider them as mushroom “seeds,” although technically speaking mushrooms don’t have seeds.
-2>Gills, Pores, or Teeth: Have you ever seen a fish’s gills? Mushroom gills look something like that. The gills are also called teeth or pores. The gill is a structure that appears right under the mushroom cap and produces spores.
-3>Ring: The ring (also known as the annulus) is a partial veil that is left on the stem. It is an extra layer of protection for the spores that grow when the mushroom is still very young. When the cap grows out and breaks through the veil, the remnant is what forms the ring around the stem.
-4>Stipe or Stem: The stipe or stem is the long, vertical part of the mushroom that holds the cap above the ground. Mushrooms growing in the wild propagate when the wind scatters the spores. For this reason, the cap and gills need to be held high enough from ground level by the stem, so that when the spores drop down, they can be carried away easily by wind.
->Note that in some mushrooms, the spores grow right down the sides of the stem. Oyster mushrooms are a good example. Also, the way that a stem is attached to the cap can be an important clue in identifying a mushroom. For example, a morel’s stem will attach to the inside of the hollow cap, whereas a false morel’s stem will attach to the bottom of the cap.
-5>Volva: Mushrooms are covered in a protective veil as they grow out of the ground. This protective veil is called the volva. The mushroom pushes through the volva as it matures, leaving parts of the veil at the bottom of the stem.
-6>Mycelium: The mycelium is a collection of thin hair-like strands that grow outward and downward into the soil in search of nutrients. The mycelium of mushrooms acts like the roots in flowering plants and can produce new mushrooms when the conditions are suitable.



About Dataset

The data set composes of 8124 number of rows of data records and 22 attributes. Each mushroom species is identified as class of edible and poisonous. These rows are distributed as 4208 edible mushrooms and 3916 poisonous mushrooms



About The Project :
In this project,I will analyze the data and build different machine learning models that will detect if the mushroom is edible or poisonous by its specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. using different classifiers. Its important to get better decision to avoid side effect of eating inedible mushrooms.


Tasks Perform by the app:

    App covers the most basic Machine Learning task of Analysis, Correlation between variables,project report.
    Machine Learning on different Machine Learning Algorithms, building different models and lastly prediction.
